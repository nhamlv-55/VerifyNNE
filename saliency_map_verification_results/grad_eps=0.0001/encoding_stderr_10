This means writing to this tensor will result in undefined behavior. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program. (Triggered internally at  /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1659484746364/work/torch/csrc/utils/tensor_numpy.cpp:172.)

/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/abc310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/onnx2pytorch/convert/model.py:163: TracerWarning: Converting a tensor to a Python boolean might cause the trace to be incorrect. We can't record the data flow of Python values, so this value will be treated as a constant in the future. This means that the trace might not generalize to other inputs!
