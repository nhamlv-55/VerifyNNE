- Found the issue: in Preprocessor.cpp, at line 833, indices are recomputed. 
However, this function based on Marabou's assumptions about variable ordering,
which we break by introducing gradient variable! Currently the fix is to turn
off variable elimination, but a better fix would be fix the ordering to be correct.
